# LeafLit

## Description

- Have you ever sat down to read a book, and thought "Hm, some tea would be nice with this book." ?

- Have you ever been at a loss trying to choose a book to read?

- Have you ever had a hard time choosing which tea to drink with your book?

If you answered yes to any of these questions, then LeafLit may be the application for you!

Our application is meant to give tea recommendations based on a chosen book, or to give both book and tea recomendations based on a chosen literary genre.

## Usage

Our application has two different uses based on a user's needs. If you need both a book recommendation and a tea recommendation, simply click the button designated to the genre you would like and the application will give you a random tea to drink and a random book to read. If you'd like to get a tea recommendation based on a specific book, simply search for the book using the application's search form and the application will give you a random tea that goes with that book.
