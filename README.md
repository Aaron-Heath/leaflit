## Usage

Our application has two different uses based on a user's needs. If you need both a book recommendation and a tea recommendation, simply click the button designated to the genre you would like and the application will give you a random tea to drink and a random book to read. If you'd like to get a tea recommendation based on a specific book, simply search for the book using the application's search form and the application will give you a random tea that goes with that book.
